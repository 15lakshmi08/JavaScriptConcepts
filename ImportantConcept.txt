The type of null is object and type of undefined is undefined.

typeof is used to check type of any value .

----------------***Stack(Primitive) and Heap(Non-Primitive) memory in javascript***------------------------------------------

Stack is used for copying of the declared variable .
And Heap memory is used for reference of declared variable means changing of origional value.


// In slice method we can give negative index but in substring method we can't give any negative index


"new" keyword is used to store key and value pairs

// convert into "seconds" because "date.now" is giving the output in "miliseconds"
// console.log(Math.floor(Date.now()/1000));


another way of conversion

console.log(newDate.toLocaleString('default',
    { weekday:"long"}
));
